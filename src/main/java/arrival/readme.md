This file is mainly used to set the event arrival rate

Assuming that the start timestamp of an event data file is $t_ {start} $, and
the end timestamp is t_ {end}

For an event type, if its total number is num, then its achievement rate is

$$
\frac{num}{t_{end} - t_{start}
$$

The arrival rate of events will be stored in JSON format files
